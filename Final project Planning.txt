Final project Planning

- Budgeting app: 

Summary: This budgeting app helps the everyday person stay aware of their spending habits and allows them to make better informed decisions with their money!

  - users can: 
    -input their income, set budget for start and end dates (so user can choose to set it as a week, 2 weeks, or a month, with whichever start and end dates they want), 
    - user can input spending,daily expense tracker (all money spent in a day), 
    - choose what they spent their money on (users can make their own categories)

    The app will:
  - Display how much is left to spend within their budget
  - Display the spending for the previous months/budget time periods - like a report, maybe use a diagram as well (how much they spent, what the budget was, and how much their income was)
  - Make the budget their income? or make it an amount the user sets?
  

* Single Page App!!!
* Also a mobile App???

What we need to do:

Database: 
  - table of users,
  - table for income
  - table for expenses
  

Functions that should be made: 
ERD: 

- Make log in and sign in
- Users Can add different expense categories


Tech Stack: React (how to make requests, use Axios? get,post, put, delete), Javascript, HTML, CSS/SASS, Node.Js
  - for database- postgresql or mysql? 

Stretch: 
- connect to actual bank account
- maybe add a section for notes (if they paid something late, this can be stretch)


different income categories: from salary, and other sources


We want the app to dynamically update spending daily as the person updates their app. This will constantly adjust the overall report and show the person if they're getting closer to their goal.

  When a person stays below budget, by the end of their time period they will be congratulated.
