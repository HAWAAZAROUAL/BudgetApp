Final project Planning
------- 
Project title: 
Project description - What problem your app solves: This app makes keeping track of financing easy. Allows you to easily set a budget, keep track of daily spending, all spending gets counted and compared to the budget. Gives the users control over how they want to budget.
    Summary: This budgeting app helps the everyday person stay aware of their spending habits and allows them to make better informed decisions with their money!

Target audience - Your app will be useful to whom?: Our app will be useful to young adults who are entering the real world to help with financial responsibility
Team members
Risks: make it a mobile app.


--------USER STORIES----------
  - users can: 
    -input their income, set budget for start and end dates (so user can choose to set it as a week, 2 weeks, or a month, with whichever start and end dates they want), 
    - user can input spending,daily expense tracker (all money spent in a day), 
    - choose what they spent their money on (users can make their own categories)

    The app will:
  - Display how much is left to spend within their budget
  - Display the spending for the previous months/budget time periods - like a report, maybe use a diagram as well (how much they spent, what the budget was, and how much their income was)
  - Make the budget their income? or make it an amount the user sets?
  

* Single Page App!!!
* Also a mobile App???

Tech Stack: 
Front-end: React, Javascript, HTML, CSS/SASS/CSS grid/Flexbox
Back-end: Node.Js, (how to make requests, use Axios? get,post, put, delete)
Database: postgresql or mysql?

What we need to do:

Database: 
  - table of users,
  - table for income
  - table for expenses
  

Functions that should be made: 
ERD: 

- Make log in and sign in
- Users Can add different expense categories

  

Stretch: 
- connect to actual bank account
- maybe add a section for notes (if they paid something late, this can be stretch)
- if testing use cypress


different income categories: from salary, and other sources


We want the app to dynamically update spending daily as the person updates their app. This will constantly adjust the overall report and show the person if they're getting closer to their goal.

  When a person stays below budget, by the end of their time period they will be congratulated.
